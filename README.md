# Coupled-Spring-Mass-System-problem using C

Done using C language, this machine problem aims to compute the displacement over time, natural frequencies, and mode shapes of 2 spring masses using the 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method for Ordinary Differential Equations and the Shifted-Inverse Power Method.

Abstract:
Springs, having multiple important roles in our community, should be studied and understood in order for it to be truly appreciated. This other part of the machine problem tackles the computation of the displacement over time of the two spring-masses along with its natural frequencies and mode shapes. Through the use of the 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method for Ordinary Differential Equations and the Shifted-Inverse Power Method, the group was able to accurately determine the characteristics of the coupled spring-mass system. The resulting graphed displacement-time values of the system resulted in a sinusoidal wave.
